## Test Team
We have 2 testers available for this project in our test team.
The testers assigned to this project are:
* `A.Patel` - Test Engineer who joined the company last week and is primarily
still completing onboarding.
* `R.Le` - Test Engineer who joined the company last week and is primarily still completing onboarding.

## Defect Management
When a tester encounters a bug, they will raise a defect on the GitHub Issues
page for the project. The tester should assign one of the following priorities:
* **1 - High:** Requires immediate attention
* **2 - Medium:** Must be addressed pre-deployment
* **3 - Low:** Can be addressed post-deployment
The list of defects will be reviewed on submission by the Development Team.
Product Owner will receive a daily update of outstanding and resolved number of defects.

## Automated testing workflow
We implemented a github actions workflow to automatically run the end to end cypress tests and unit tests on every push.
We initially had some issues due to setting the wait-on function to port 3000 when our test server was running on port 3030. Following this issue the next error was for a missing cypress configuration file which we resolved by generating a simple file which defined the javascript framework the project is using. Finally the configuration file didn't define a base URL which meant the cy.visit function was looking through the directory for files rather than the routes on the localhost server. This was resolved by setting the baseURL for the end to end tests in the config file.

## Exploratory testing - initial phase
High character limit
Password, username, email field validators not working
Only works on test server - test server has access to database, normal does not

  * Routes in files aren't clear what pages exist
    - in the cypress integration files the routes are displayed
  * Can create a new user using existing login information but it doesnt overide the previous details and the new login doesnt work.
    - There should be an error message when siging up with existing information and it keeps you on the same page.
  * User new and sessions new look identical and the only way to distinguish whether youre on the right page is by checking the URL.
  * Account can be created with a blank username and password, there is now a acc user “ “ and password “ “
    - There should be an error message when siging up with existing information and it keeps you on the same page. There should be validator checks for each of the forms i.e. unique username and email with a password of a sufficient length (maybe with a character limit as well).
  * Home route page has a log out button implying youre logged in which might not be right (maybe remove the button from that page entirely).
    - Should have links to both log in page (sessions new) and sign up page (users new)
  * Sometimes creating new user on users new automatically logs in when submitting
    - unsure how to replicate
  * Email validation allows " " but if you use characters then it allowed "a@a" minimum character before and after.
  * Password can be a small as 1 character " " or "abc" no validation checks yet.
  * You can make a post with no content, there should be some validation for post creation.

## Entry Criteria
Testing will commence when:
* The testing team have been notified of the testing requirements and have access to the testing environment.
## Exit Criteria
The test plan has passed when all functionality has been tested and passed.
## Risks
The following table outlines all of the risks associated with this test plan,
and how we intend to mitigate them:
| Risk | Mitigation | Priority |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- |
| Recent intermittent internet access in our office. | Allow testers to work from remote/home as needed. | Low |
| We might find more bugs than the developers have time to fix. | Follow the defect prioritisation and management policy | Medium |
| We’ve not tested to see how well the site performs with multiple users. | Arrange for some performance testing to happen after launch. | Medium |
| Compatability issues since entire testing env is using Mac and only testing Chrommium browsers | Schedule testing for other OS and browsers as more testers become available | Low |
