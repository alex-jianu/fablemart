## Test Team
We have 2 testers available for this project in our test team.
The testers assigned to this project are:
* `A.Patel` - Test Engineer who joined the company last week and is primarily
still completing onboarding.
* `R.Le` - Test Engineer who joined the company last week and is primarily still completing onboarding.

## Defect Management
When a tester encounters a bug, they will raise a defect on the GitHub Issues
page for the project. The tester should assign one of the following priorities:
* **1 - High:** Requires immediate attention
* **2 - Medium:** Must be addressed pre-deployment
* **3 - Low:** Can be addressed post-deployment
The list of defects will be reviewed on submission by the Development Team.
Product Owner will receive a daily update of outstanding and resolved number of defects.

## Entry Criteria
Testing will commence when:
* The testing team have been notified of the testing requirements and have access to the testing environment.
## Exit Criteria
The test plan has passed when all functionality has been tested and passed.
## Risks
The following table outlines all of the risks associated with this test plan,
and how we intend to mitigate them:
| Risk | Mitigation | Priority |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- |
| Recent intermittent internet access in our office. | Allow testers to work from remote/home as needed. | Low |
| We might find more bugs than the developers have time to fix. | Follow the defect prioritisation and management policy | Medium |
| We’ve not tested to see how well the site performs with multiple users. | Arrange for some performance testing to happen after launch. | Medium |
| Compatability issues since entire testing env is using Mac and only testing Chrommium browsers | Schedule testing for other OS and browsers as more testers become available | Low |
